                    <div class="item-desc">Rome is the
                        capital city and a special comune of Italy (named Comune di Roma Capitale) as well as the
                        capital of the Lazio region. The city has been a major human settlement for almost three
                        millennia. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), it is also the country's most
                        populated comune. It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within
                        city limits. It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of
                        4,355,725 residents, thus making it the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. Its
                        metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. Rome is located in the
                        central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the
                        Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the
                        city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason
                        Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states.</div>

                        Sicily is the largest island in
                        the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 20 regions of Italy. It is one of the five Italian
                        autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana. It has 5 million
                        inhabitants. Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea, south of the Italian Peninsula,
                        from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina. Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna, the
                        tallest active volcano in Europe, and one of the most active in the world, currently 3,329 m
                        (10,922 ft) high. The island has a typical Mediterranean climate.

                    <div class="item-desc">
                        Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto
                        region. It is situated on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and
                        linked by over 400 bridges. The islands are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an
                        enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between
                        the Brenta and the Sile). In 2018, 260,897 people resided in the Comune di Venezia, of whom
                        around 55,000 live in the historical city of Venice. Together with Padua and
                        Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area, which is
                        considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.

                <div class="container__content__item">The Colosseum
                    <div class="item-desc">The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian
                        Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
                        Built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete, it was the
                        largest amphitheatre ever built at the time and held 50,000 to 80,000 spectators. The Colosseum
                        is just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and
                        was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made
                        during the reign of Domitian (81–96). These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty,
                        and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).

                    <div class="item-desc">
                        <p>Gaius Julius Caesar (12 July 100 BC
                            – 15 March 44 BC) was a Roman general and statesman who played a critical role in the events
                            that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.</p>
                        <p>In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, a political alliance that
                            dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares were
                            opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the
                            frequent support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman
                            Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC,
                            which greatly extended Roman territory. During this time he both invaded Britain and built a
                            bridge across the Rhine river. These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to
                            eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of
                            Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down
                            from his military command and return to Rome. Leaving his command in Gaul would mean losing his
                            immunity to criminal prosecution by his enemies; knowing this, Caesar openly defied the
                            Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army. This
                            began Caesar's civil war, which he won, leaving him in a position of near unchallenged power
                            and influence.</p>

                <div class="container__content__item">Augustus
                    <div class="item-desc">Augustus (23 September 63 BC – 19
                        August AD 14) was the first Roman emperor, reigning from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.
                        His status as the founder of the Roman Principate has consolidated an enduring legacy as one of
                        the most effective and controversial leaders in human history. The reign of Augustus
                        initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana. The Roman world was largely free
                        from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial
                        expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the "Year of the Four
                        Emperors" over the imperial succession.</div>
