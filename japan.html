                    <div class="item-desc">
                        Kyoto, officially Kyoto City, is the capital city of Kyoto Prefecture in Japan. Located in the
                        Kansai region on the island of Honshu, Kyoto forms a part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area
                        along with Osaka and Kobe. As of 2018, the city had a population of 1.47 million.

                        In 794, Kyoto (then known as Heian-kyō) was chosen as the new seat of Japan's imperial court.
                        The original city was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the
                        model of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang'an. The Imperial Palace faced south, resulting in
                        Ukyō (the right sector of the capital) being on the west while Sakyō (the left sector) is on the
                        east. The streets in the modern-day wards of Nakagyō, Shimogyō, and Kamigyō-ku still follow a
                        grid pattern.
